here what we are doing is, 
every two adjacent numbers will have one bit difference, so whenever we xor both of them one 1 will become zero. In the same way all one's will become zero 
in the count of 1 steps, we don't have to iterate through the length of the number.


int count=0;
while(number!=0){
    number= number & number-1;
    count++;
}
return count;
